    <h1>My litle Web</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my little web!</p>
    <p>This work was created for the Operating System Fundamentals class in the second semester of UCJC's first year Robotics and Ai course. It was written in the nano editor and was created to practice terminal skills and understanding of the file system. Below I will briefly describe the history of Linux, after which I will leave references to commands and ways of working with the bash language in the appropriate sections.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Brief History of Linux</h3>
    
    <p>Linux is an open-source operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. It was developed as a free and open alternative to proprietary UNIX systems. Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki, started the project as a hobby but soon attracted contributions from developers worldwide.</p>
    
    <p>Initially, Linux was just a kernel, requiring external components like the GNU utilities to form a complete operating system. The adoption of the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1992 ensured that Linux remained free and open-source, leading to the rapid growth of its community and ecosystem.</p>
    
    <p>By the mid-1990s, several distributions (distros) emerged, making Linux more accessible. Debian, Slackware, and Red Hat became some of the most influential early distributions. Linux gained traction in academic and enterprise environments due to its stability, security, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
    
    <p>During the 2000s, Linux saw significant adoption in server environments, with major corporations like IBM and Oracle providing support. The rise of cloud computing further propelled Linux into mainstream use, as it became the foundation for platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud.</p>
    
    <p>In the 2010s, Linux became ubiquitous in mobile computing through Android, which is based on the Linux kernel. It also powered most of the worldâ€™s supercomputers, embedded systems, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Today, Linux continues to be a cornerstone of modern computing, known for its flexibility, efficiency, and strong community support.</p>
