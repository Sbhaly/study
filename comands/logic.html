    <h1>System Logic</h1>
    <p>The Linux operating system is built on a modular structure that follows a layered architecture. The key components of its functionality are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Kernel</b>: The core of the operating system, managing hardware and system resources.</li>
        <li><b>Shell</b>: The command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system.</li>
        <li><b>File System</b>: A hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories.</li>
        <li><b>Processes</b>: Every running program is a process that the kernel schedules and manages.</li>
        <li><b>Memory Management</b>: The system dynamically allocates and deallocates memory.</li>
        <li><b>Networking</b>: Provides tools for communication between systems.</li>
        <li><b>Permissions & Security</b>: Manages access control and user authentication.</li>
        <li><b>Package Management</b>: Allows installing, updating, and removing software.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding these fundamental components allows users to optimize system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.</p>
